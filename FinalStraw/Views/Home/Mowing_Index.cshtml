                    Lawn Care Service

                    While some homeowners choose to perform their own lawn maintenance many other homeowners opt for hiring a seasoned professional to care for their lawn on an ongoing basis. Lawn care services can vary quite a bit depending on the needs of the homeowner as well as the business itself. Here are a few of the many services offered by landscapers and lawn care companies.

                    Lawn Mowing - Sometimes homeowners simply need someone to come mow their lawn once a week or so. You can easily set up a recurring schedule with a local landscaper to come out and cut your lawn at a set weekly or monthly price.
                    Fertilizing - Got problems with your grass? If so, a landscaper can provide a fertilizer program to give you a nice full lawn of grass. There are many different types of fertilizer based on the type of soil you have, geography, topography, insects, etc. A lawn care professional can help you choose the best fertilizer as well as the best frequency to apply fertilizer throughout the year.
                    Resodding and Reseeding - No grass or dead grass? No problem. Landscapers can resod or reseed your entire lawn so that you can grow out that beautiful lawn you always wanted.
                    Renovations - Additional services include removing old dead shrubs and replacing them with live plants, bushes, etc. Walkways can be built, mulch can be added, and a landscaper can perform any type of lawn remodeling you have in mind.

                    While some companies might specialize in just lawn mowing many larger landscaping companies can provide the whole package including fertilizing and complete landscape remodeling. Prices vary by size of yard, work needed, geography, etc. Always contact multiple companies to get the best price.
