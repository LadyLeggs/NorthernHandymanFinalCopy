Winter Services Available

       Pretreating - Consists of coating a surface with rock salt, calcium or salt brine before a storm. Anti-icing is a service provided for high end properties where it is necessary to prevent the bond between snow and ice to the pavement, this in return prevents dangerous snow pack and ice under the snow. This also allows for a safer property during a storm and cleaner snow removal after the storm.




       De-Icing - Performed after plowing or to remove snow falls 1 inch or less. De-Icing is the process of applying rock salt or calcium chloride to sidewalks, roadways or parking lots.





        Snow Plowing -  Performed after 1 inch of snow has accumulated. This is performed using trucks, bobcats and front end loaders.






        Snow Removal - Haul away consists of removing snow from an area using loaders and trucks. This can be set up on a regular basis or as needed.
