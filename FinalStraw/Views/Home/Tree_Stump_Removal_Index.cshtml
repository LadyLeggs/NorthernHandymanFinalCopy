                                Dead branches are the result of a tree's natural life cycle.
                                The dead limbs can become a site for diseases, fungus and molds.
                                Pruning the dead wood can help to transform the trees on your
                                property into healthy, beautiful well-manicured landscape design.

                            Every tree is either an asset or liability.
                            Tree removals are performed to eliminate dead and dying trees. 
                            We provide thorough clean up of debris and strive 
                            to minimize the impact to surrounding vegetation.
                            As part of the tree removal process, the stump will typically be left as close to the
                            ground as possible. If needed, removal of the stump can be provided.

                            Do you have a section of your property that's never been
                            used because nature has had its way?
                            Would you like to add this section to your usable property,
                            or, perhaps, expand your existing lawn? The Northern Handyman

                            trees, stumps, rocks and brush that stand in the way.
